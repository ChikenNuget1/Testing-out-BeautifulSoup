Testing out BeautifulSoup.

A fun library to scrape the web. I don't think there are many use-cases for this library for a personal project.
I'm having fun just extracting the links from the wikipedia article or bouncing between different links.

I do feel that this kind of stuff would be useful for data-gathering on a site.
